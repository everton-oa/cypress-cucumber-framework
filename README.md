# Cypress Automation Study Project

Welcome to my personal automation study project! 🎉

As a **QA Engineer**, I’ve had the opportunity to work with various languages, tools, and frameworks throughout my career. After spending some time focused on other areas, I’m returning to automation and created this project as part of my learning journey.

## Purpose

This repository serves two primary purposes:

1. **Learning and Practice**: To apply concepts and exercises from the automation courses I’m currently taking.
2. **Personal Library**: To document notes, patterns, and solutions that will act as a reference for future projects.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using:

- **OS: Linux**
- **IDE: Visual Studio Code**
- **Programming language: JavaScript**
- **Testing framework: Cypress**
- **Testing framework: Mocha**
- **Library: JQuery**
- **Library: Cucumber**
- **Git/GitHub**
- **Selectors Plugin - [Ranorex Selocity](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ranorex-selocity/ocgghcnnjekfpbmafindjmijdpopafoe)**

## Goals

1. Reinforce automation testing skills.
2. Explore and document advanced Cypress features.
3. Practice Git workflows and improve repository management using GitHub.
4. Create a reusable resource for future projects.
